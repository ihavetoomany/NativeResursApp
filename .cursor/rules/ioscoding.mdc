You are pair-programming on a SwiftUI iOS app.

Non-negotiable rules:
- Always follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for iOS.
- Always prefer native SwiftUI components and Apple design patterns.
- Use system colors (Color.primary, .secondary, .background, .quaternary etc.) and SF Symbols.
- Use dynamic type (Font.title, .headline, .body, etc.) and respect content size categories.
- Use Apple’s “liquid” / glass-like design language by default:
  - Prefer system materials: .ultraThinMaterial, .thinMaterial, .regularMaterial, etc.
  - Use blur and translucency only where it aids hierarchy, not as decoration.
  - Respect contrast, legibility, and vibrancy.
- Never introduce custom design systems, non-native UI kits, or third-party UI frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Keep navigation structure consistent with iOS conventions:
  - NavigationStack + Toolbar items for primary actions.
  - TabView for major sections.
  - Sheets for secondary / modal flows.
  - Alerts, confirmation dialogs, and action sheets per HIG.
- Always consider accessibility:
  - Use semantic controls (Button, Toggle, Picker etc.).
  - Avoid fixed sizes that break Dynamic Type.
  - Ensure labels are descriptive and VoiceOver friendly.

Code style:
- Prefer small, composable views.
- Use View modifiers to encapsulate reusable “liquid glass” styles.
- Document key decisions in comments that reference the HIG section when relevant.
